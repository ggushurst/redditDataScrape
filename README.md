# About
This webscraper will pull data (title, username, votes, comment count) from the front page of reddit (or any other subreddit). The data is then saved as a json file, and sent to a postgreSQL database to be used for further analysis

## To use:

1. Install postgreSQL (***https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/tutorial-createdb.html***) and initialize a database named: ***redditData***
2. Run the program!

### Planned features
- Reddit api support
- AWS integration
- Timed autorun cycle
- Full docker support
